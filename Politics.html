                 ">By Politics I will not be talking about politics as a whole, who to vote for or what each political party is. Rather I will be talking about one treaty that has been repeatedly called one of the worst deals ever.</h3>
    <h2 style = "color:red;text-align:center;font-size:35px">NATO</h2>


    <p >NATO stands for the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, initially created in 1949 right after the Second World War. It was initially created to combat the growing Communist threat, and to prevent its spread in the newly freed Democracies that were still weakened, so the US created an alliance with 11 newly freed countries.</p>

    
    <p>The idea was simple. If the Soviet Union invaded even one country all of the other countries would rush to their aid, prompting the Soviet Union to think twice about invading any one of the European countries. But there was a problem. While the U.S boasted one of the largest militaries in the world the rest of the members had weak militaries, if they had one at all. So really it wasn't a treaty, it was just a way of saying the Uncle Sam had their back</p>
    
    <p>To protect themselves they allowed the U.S to build military bases and situate troops within their borders, giving the U.S a first line of defense against the Soviets. And the U.S kept saying and confirming that it would rush to the defense of its allies</p>
    
    
    <p >When Europe was divided up the Soviet Union got a large chunk of Europe, which was later called the Eastern Bloc. The Soviets and Stalin immediately turned all of them into communist puppet states, and cracked down on democracy and freedom, replacing one cruel dictator and regime with another.</p>



    <p>However when the Soviet Union collapsed in December of 1991 many saw NATO as pointless, since their main ideological enemy and threat had been removed, and the U.S was the world's sole superpower. And so that raised the question as to whether they should keep existing. </p>


    <p>But many U.S and European leaders wanted it to continue to ensure peace and security in Europe. And then they starting adding old members of the Eastern Blocs, and started interfering outside its own interests. </p>


    <p>However some U.S leaders were wondering if these alliances were worth keeping. The U.S had asked its allies to use atleast 2% of its GDP to help NATo, but only seven have actually done that even with their small GDPs compared to their allies. Additionally when Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014 it raised the question as to whether the U.S would actually go to war with Russia over a small country, like one of the Baltic States.</p>

    <p >In conclusion it seems unlikely that NATO should continue existing. Not only does the US put a huge amounts of its budget, but if any small country <b>does</b> end up getting invaded then the US has to either go to war over it or prove that NATO doesn't work, both of which aren't the best option </p>
